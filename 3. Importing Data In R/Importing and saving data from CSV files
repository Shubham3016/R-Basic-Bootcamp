Importing and saving data from CSV files
----------------------------------------------------

It is very common for publically-available data to be stored in text files. Text files can be read on virtually any computer 
or operating system, making the format nearly universal. 

They can also be exported and imported from/to programs such as Microsoft Excel, 
providing a quick and easy way to work with spreadsheet data.

A tabular (as in "table") data file is structured in matrix form, in such a way that each line of text reflects
one example, and each example has the same number of features.
The feature values on each line are separated by a predefined symbol known as a delimiter. 
Often, the first line of a tabular data file lists the names of the columns of data. This is called a header line.

Perhaps the most common tabular text file format is the Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file, which as the name suggests,
uses the comma as a delimiter. 
The CSV files can be imported to and exported from many common applications.

A CSV file representing the medical dataset constructed previously would look as follows:
=-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

name,temperature,flu_status,gender,blood_type
John,98.1,FALSE,MALE,O
Bob,98.6,FALSE,FEMALE,AB
Steve Graves,101.4,TRUE,MALE,A

# Csv File format and save the data in .csv format which will be shown in Excel in following way 


name    	temperature  	flu_status        gender	   blood_type
John        98.1       	 FALSE	           MALE        	O
Bob	        98.6      	 FALSE	           FEMALE       AB
Steve	      101.4	        TRUE             MALE	        A
